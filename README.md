## Character Vault

This "vault bot" enables a party to enable an approval concept of Dungeons and Dragons characters from [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters) (or 'stub' characters not on dndbeyond using the `!register manual` command) and the changes they make to them via [Discord](https://discordapp.com).  This allows a (or multiple) DMs to ensure that the character changes that a user makes on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters) are accurate for their campaigns.

The primary driver for this functionality was watching so many DM/GMs trying to manage [West Marches](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) type Discord servers using spreadsheets/etc.  The bot works great for "non" West Marches type campaigns as well!  This can make things a bit easier to maintain for online Dungeons and Dragons players and DMs.

Approval functionality is configured 'false' by default, enable it by running `!config approval true`.

## Events

The bot also offers the ability to schedule events (missions) and allow attendees (party members) to sign up for attendance, or remove themselves from attendance.  The bot will also convert the default time (GMT) to the user's local timezone upon request via the clock reaction on the event.  Events can be 'deployed' to show that they are 'approved' and have all the proper components (DM/GM, attendees, etc).

Event campaign enforcement is configured off ('false') by default.  Turning it on ensures that the players that sign up for an event have a 'character' in the vault that is also related to the event's campaign (if set) via `!campaign` or a dndbeyond's campaign).  Turn this on by issuing `!config campaign true`

Users have the ability to list events that are deployed or proposed (not yet approved/deployed).

### Subscribe to the iCalendar ICS

Once a user signs up as an attendee, or creates an event, those events will show up in that user's iCalendar ICS feed.  The user can subscribe to the iCalendar ICS feed within Outlook, Google Calendar, iCal, etc.  When a user clicks on the 'Timezone' button, a message is sent to them with their local timezone as well as a link to their personalized iCalendar ICS link.

## Polling

Users can create polls very simply by using the `poll` command.  `!poll "Do you like polling"` will create a default poll that has three options:  üëç (yes) üëé (no) and ü§∑ (I don't know).  A user can also create his own options, which will be automatically numbered by using this syntax: `!poll "Do you like polling" "hell no" "I LOVE polling" "What is polling?"`.

## Rolling dice

Users can roll dice by using the `roll` command.  The dice roller uses [notation](https://greenimp.github.io/rpg-dice-roller/guide/notation/).

### Die quantity

- A single die has a minimum quantity of 1, and a maximum quantity of 999.
- These are valid: d8, 1d10, 999d6, 20d4 + 999d10
- These are not: 0d10, 1000d6, -1d20

### Example usages

```diff
roll 2 20 sided dice
!roll 2d20

roll 8 20 sided dice and drop the lowest 1
!roll 8d20dl1

values less than 3 are treated as 3
!roll 4d6min3

values greater than 3 are treated as 3
!roll 4d6max3

reroll dice if a 1 is rolled
!roll 1d6r

reroll dice if one is less than 3
!roll 1d6r<3

roll 4 100 sided dice
!roll 4d100

above is the same as rolling percentile dice
!roll 4d%

roll 4 fudge dice
!roll 4dF

```

## Commands

### Functionality Documentation

- [Character Vault](#character-vault)
- [Events](#events)
- [Polling](#polling)
- [Rolling dice](#rolling-dice)

All the below commands have been implemented as **slash** (ex: `/register_manual`) commands, and are recommended to be used over the 'old style' prefix (ex: `!register manual`) commands.

All commands that are implemented have a `[x]` next to them.  This is a list of commands that are already implemented as well as commands that are planned.

The brackets below (such as in `register manual [CHARACTER_NAME] [CHARACTER_CLASS] [CHARACTER_LEVEL] [CHARACTER_RACE] {CAMPAIGN}`) are to show you 'placeholders' for arguments that needs to be passed to the command.  `[]` brackets mean that arguments are **required** and `{}` brackets mean that the content is **optional**.

**Roll initiative!**

### Slash Commands

In order to see the new slash commands and their accompanying options and descriptions, just start a slash command by typing `/` and click on `D&D Vault` and you'll see a list of all the available commands.

## Example character workflow with the BOT

Workflow would work something like this.

- Discord users join a server and decide to have a campaign.
- Server owner invites BOT
- Each user creates a character for campaign on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters)
- Each user 'registers' character with BOT
- DM 'approves' each character
- Mission occurs
- Users update characters on [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com/my-characters)
- Users request 'update' of character with BOT
- DM 'lists queued' character approvals
- DM reviews 'changes' of character
- DM 'approves' character changes

all the while anyone on the server can 'view' any user's character ...

## Example character workflow usage with approvals 'true'

```diff
#player types
!register https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/BlacknTan/characters/41867999
#approver role user types
!list queued
!changes 41867999
!approve 41867999
#player types, to update character
!update https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/BlacknTan/characters/41867999
#approver role user types
!list queued
!changes 41867999
!approve 41867999
```

## Run the bot yourself

If you would like to run your own instance of the D&D Vault Bot instead of using the one that is hosted for the community, it's open source, so **have at it**!!

The first thing that is required is an instance of mongodb.  The easiest way to bring up mongo, is to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Below is a few docker commands (meant to be run via linux/unix/macos shell).  In order for it to work, you need to do the following:

- install DOCKER!
- create a directory in which mongo data will be stored on your host system, the one referenced below is `/home/user/dnd-mongo`.  Once you create that directory, replace the `VOLUME=`, below, with your full directory name.
- create a text file called `mongoadmin` in the mongo data directory that you just created.  place the password that you want the mongo db admin to be/use in that file.
- create a directory with the SAME NAME as the data directory above, but add `-init` to it.  create a file called `1-create-user.js` in that directory.  that file should contain the below, replace `xxxxxxxxxx` with the password you wish the bot to use to connect to mongo.

```js
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "dnduser",
     pwd: "xxxxxxxxxx",
     roles: [
        {
            role: "readWrite",
            db: "dnd"
        }
     ]
   }
)
```

- create a docker network for mongo and dnd-vault to use.  Use this command to do that: `docker network create dnd-net`
- After all the above is complete, run the below command to create and run your mongodb container for the dndvault bot.

```sh
export VOLUME=/home/user/dnd-mongo
docker run -d --network dnd-net --name dnd-mongo \
    --restart always \
    -p 27017:27017 \
    --ulimit nofile=64000:64000 \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=dnd \
    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE=/data/db/mongoadmin \
    -v ${VOLUME}:/data/db \
    -v ${VOLUME}-init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d \
    mongo:4.4.3-bionic
```

- now that mongdb is running, let's run the bot!  Create a directory for the dndvault bot config, and replace the `VOLUME=`, below, with that directory.
- create a file called config.json and copy [this example config](https://github.com/jcolson/dndvault-bot/blob/master/config_example.json) file into it.
  - Replace `token` with your discord bot token.
  - Replace `mongoServer` with `dnd-mongo`
  - Replace `mongoUser` with `dnduser` (from your `1-create-user.js` script that you created above)
  - Replace `mongoPass` with your `1-create-user.js` password that you created above
  - Replace `adminUser` with your discord id (this is so you don't accidentally lock yourself out of the bot config)
  - Remove `debugGuild`
  - Replace `key` with your discord bot key for oauth support on the web
  - Replace `secret` with your discord bot secret key for oauth support on web
  - Replace `inviteURL` with your discord bot's invite url
- You are now ready to run the bot, execute the below (remember to replace the `VOLUME=` with your own bot config directory that you made above)!

```sh
docker pull karmanet/dndvault && \
export VOLUME=/home/user/dndvault && \
docker run --name dndvault -v ${VOLUME}:/config \
--network dnd-net \
--restart always -d karmanet/dndvault:latest
```

Let me know if you have any troubles with the above on the support discord server.  Cheers!

### Permissions required for bot

If you plan on deploying your own copy of the D&D Vault (you don't need to, you can [invite the existing bot by clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=792843392664993833&permissions=223296&scope=bot)), invite the bot to your server using these permissions.

![bot_permissions](docs/images/bot_permissions.png)

## Developer contributions

My workflow is very simple.

- I work in the development branch, so if you fork and wish to contribute PR's please submit them to development.
- From development I will tag a release and then PR it to the docker branch, where a docker image is generated and published via the github workflow.
- From the docker branch docker, I'll PR to the master branch.

### pre-commit

Please also install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), as it ensures that any 'pre commit' triggers/checks/tests are run prior to your commits.

If you are pushing something that you really don't need (or want) to do the docker test for:

`SKIP=npm-dockertest git push`

### run nodemon

to quickly restart node while developing - I recommend [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/).

`nodemon`

## Notes

**_This section can be safely ignored, it's my scratchpad ..._**

### create change log for release

i actually use my own github-release.sh script at this point, which includes this step in a release

```sh
npm run changelog
```

### Test via docker container

```sh
docker build --target test ./
```

### Mongodb queries

```mongodb
{id: { $regex: /785567026512527390/i }}
#my test guild
{guildID: '785567026512527390'}
```

### Bot Commands for testing

```sh
